 * Description:
 *  This file handles the front end work for the website.  This file makes the route calls to twitter,
 *  and possibly other social media sites.  Once the json packet is returned, we will forward it to the
 *  backend python file app.py for processing.  The file app.py will return the desired results of the
 *  json packet to this JS file.  It will then display the information to the html page.
